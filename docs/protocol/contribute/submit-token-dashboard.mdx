# Token Explorer Submission

You want your token to show up on the [Superfluid Explorer](https://Explorer.superfluid.finance/)? Look no further.
In order to list a new token on the [Superfluid Explorer](https://Explorer.superfluid.finance/) and have it visible in our Dashboard, please follow the steps below.

:::warning Disclaimer
If your token looks like a potential scam or we can't find reliable information about your project/company, we reserve the right to avoid listing it on our visual Dashboard.
:::

## Steps to List Your Token

### 1. Fill out the form

You will find the form below. If you prefer, you can also access it [here](https://airtable.com/appxGogNpt64ImOFH/shrzOcdK9eveDmRWV).

<TokenListingForm/>

### 2. Issue Created

When you submit the Airtable form, it auto-generates a Github issue in our Token Assets repository. You can find the issues [here](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/assets/issues).

The Superfluid team will use the informations from the issue to add the token to the Explorer and to our protocol resolver. Hang tight!

### 3. Confirmation

The issue will be closed upon completion or rejection. Wait for a confirmation by the Superfluid team to the Discord handle you provided in the form before sharing publicly that your token is now live on Superfluid.

If you don't hear back from us within a week or need more information on the listing process, please feel free to reach out via email at [support@superfluid.finance](mailto:support@superfluid.finance) or reach out to us in the Support Channel of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pPzPEDMVua).
