# StreamYoink! : A Farcaster game based on Superfluid

## Introduction

StreamYoink! is a capture-the-flag game based on Superfluid.
The game is played in Farcaster Frame where players can click on the button in order to Yoink (catch) a stream of [🎩$DEGEN](https://www.degen.tips/) tokens.
Whoever has the Flag, keeps the stream of [🎩$DEGEN](https://www.degen.tips/) tokens.
Whoever manages to keep the stream for the longest time wins the game.

To see what the game looks like in action checkout this farcaster cast: https://warpcast.com/vijay/0xbf609fe5

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to set up the game on your local machine, and create your own version of the game using a different Super Token or a different game mechanic.

## Prerequisites
- Clone the [frames.js](https://framesjs.org/) [repo](https://github.com/framesjs/frames.js/tree/main/examples/framesjs-starter) for debugging. For further information on this, please refer to the frames.js [quickstart](https://framesjs.org/#quickstart).
- Start by installing the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn add`.
- Run the frames.js debugger using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

Congratulations! You are now ready to start debugging frames using [frames.js](https://framesjs.org/)!

## Quickstart

### Step 1: Clone the StreamYoink! repo
Start by cloning the StreamYoink! repository from [here](https://github.com/youssefea/stream-yoink):
    
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/youssefea/stream-yoink
```
### Step 2: Install the dependencies
Navigate to the StreamYoink! directory and install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn add`.
```bash
$ cd stream-yoink
$ npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure your environment variables
Check out the `.env.template` [file](https://github.com/youssefea/stream-yoink/blob/main/.env.template) and create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

#### URL Variables
For local testing and debugging, you can use the following variables and ignore `PROD_URL`:
```bash
ENVIRONMENT="local"
LOCALHOST="http://localhost:3001"
PROD_URL=""
```
When you deploy to production, you will need to fill in the `PROD_URL` variable with the URL of your deployed project, and change the `ENVIRONMENT` variable to `prod`.

#### KV Store variables:
To get your KV Store variables, you need to create a [KV Store](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv/quickstart) on Vercel:
- Open your [vercel](https://vercel.com) account and create a new project.
- Create a new deployment and deploy your project from your repository (_don't worry about the deployment failing, we just need to create a vercel store_).
- Follow the vercel KV [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv/quickstart) to create a new KV store.
- Once your KV Store is created copy variables you get to fill in the `.env` file:

```bash
KV_URL=
KV_REST_API_URL=
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=
```

#### Other variables:
You will also need to fill in the following variables:

- `AIRSTACK_KEY`: Your API Key from [Airstack](https://app.airstack.xyz/):
```bash
#Airstack key
AIRSTACK_KEY=
```
- `WK`: The private key of the wallet you will use to sponsor the streams:
```bash
#Pvt key of the wallet
WK=
```
- `RPC_URL`: The RPC URL of the network you are using:
```bash
#RPC URL
RPC_URL=
```
- `SUPER_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: The address of the Super Token you will use in the game:
```bash
# Super token (DEGENx) address
SUPER_TOKEN_ADDRESS=
```
:::warning About the chain
The default chain in the repo is Base. If you are using a different chain, you will need to change the chain of the game in the `api.ts`, `app/start/config.ts` and `app/check/config.ts` files.
For further information on this, please refer to the [Changing the chain](#changing-the-chain) section.
:::

- `FID`: The Farcaster ID of the profile you want users to follow before they play StreamYoink!:
```bash
# FID of the profile to follow
FID=
```

### Step 4: Run the project
You can now run the project using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
Congratulations! You are successfully running StreamYoink! on your local machine.

### Step 5: Test and debug
You can now test and debug the game by opening the URL `http://localhost:3000/debug?url=http://localhost:3001` in your browser.

:::info Debugging using other frameworks
In this guide, we used [frames.js](https://framesjs.org/) for debugging. Check out the [frames.js documentation](https://framesjs.org/) for further guidance on that.
You can use any other debugging framework you are comfortable with.

## Customizing the game
### Changing the images
The game has a few images that are static. While the static images are hardcoded in `app/start` and `app/check`, the images that are generated dynamically use an API endpoint that is part of the repo at `app/imgen`.
This API allows you to generate PNG images with the following parameters:
- `text`: The text you want to display on the image. "_" will be replaced with a skip line.
- `color`: The color of the text for each line of the text. Line colors are separated by a comma.
- `size`: The size of the text for each line of the text. Line sizes are separated by a comma.
- `background`: The background color of the image.

#### Example
To generate an image with the text "Hello World" in red and blue with a white background, you can use the following URL:
```bash
http://localhost:3001/imgen?text=Hello_World&color=red,blue&size=20,30&background=grey
```
This will generate an image with the text "Hello" in red and "World" in blue with a grey background like the one below:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
   ![Hello World](/assets/helloworld.png)
</div>
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <p>*An example of an image generated using the `imgen` API*</p>
</div>

:::tip customize your logo
Everything is made customizable in the `imgen` api, from the colors to the text and the images.
You can change also change the logo by replacing the `logo.svg` file in the `public` directory.
:::

### Changing the game mechanics
The game mechanics are defined in the `app/start` and `app/check` directories. You can change the game mechanics by modifying the `route.ts` files under these directories.

- **Change the flow rate of the stream**: You can change the flow rate of your stream by modifying the `route.ts` file in the `app/check` directory and changing the `flowRate` variable.
Flow rates are defined in the Superfluid framework as a number of weis per second. For example, a flow rate of 1 token/second means that 10^18 wei will be transferred every second.

```typescript title="/app/check/route.ts"
/*Imports and other constants*/
/*...*/

const reyoinkedString ="https://i.imgur.com/jfySrCh.png";
const flowRate = 327245050000000000;

/* Remaining code */
/*...*/
```
- **Change the minimum balance in the pot to keep the game going**: You can change the minimum balance in the pot to keep the game going by modifying the `route.ts` file in the `app/start` directory and changing the `minBalance` variable.

```typescript title="/app/start/route.ts"
/*Imports and other constants*/
/*...*/
const minBalance = 5000;
/* Remaining code */
/*...*/
```
- **Change the cool down time limit for the game**: You can change the time limit for the game by modifying the `route.ts` file in the `app/check` directory and changing the `coolDown` variable.

```typescript title="/app/check/route.ts"
/*Imports and other constants*/
/*...*/
const coolDown = 3600;
/* Remaining code */
/*...*/
```
### Changing the chain
The chain variables are defined in `api.ts`, `app/start/config.ts` and `app/check/config.ts` files:
- **Change the chain of your Super Token**: You can change the chain of the Super Token by changing the `chain` variable of `walletClient` and `publicClient` in the `config.ts` files.

```typescript title="/app/check/config.ts or /app/start/config.ts"
// Change the chain of the Super Token here
export const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: base,
  transport:  http(process.env.RPC_URL)
})

export const account = privateKeyToAccount(`0x${process.env.WK}`)
```
- **Change the subgraph endpoint to match the chain**: You can change the subgraph endpoint of the Super Token by changing the `subgraphURL` variable in the `api.ts` file.
```typescript title="/api.ts"
/*Imports and other constants*/
/*...*/
const subgraphURL = "https://base-mainnet.subgraph.x.superfluid.dev/";
/* Remaining code */
/*...*/
```

:::tip Where to find the subgraph endpoints?
You can find all the subgraph endpoints of Superfluid from [the console](https://console.superfluid.finance/subgraph) or from the [metadata file](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/dev/packages/metadata/main/networks/list.cjs) of the [Superfluid Protocol Monorepo](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/tree/dev).

## Understanding the architecture
Most of the relevant parts of the game are in the `app` directory. The `app` directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

- **`page.tsx`**: This directory contains the code for the initial frame of the game. It is responsible for displaying the game's name and a CTA to start the game.
- **`start`**: This directory contains the code for the first post call `{URL}/start`. It is responsible for checking if the user is following the account specified in the env variables
and displaying the current yoinker, as well as the balance of the token left to yoink.
- **`check`**: This directory contains the code for the second post call `{URL}/check`. It is responsible for checking if the user has a connected account and
and then it manages all the logic of closing the previous stream and creating a new one
- **`imgen`**: This directory contains the code for the image generator API. It is responsible for generating PNG images with the specified text, color, size, and background.
- **`totalYoinked`**: This directory contains the code for the total yoinked API. It is responsible for returning the total amount of tokens yoinked in the game.
- **`currentYoinkerApi`**: This directory contains the code for the current yoinker API. It is responsible for returning the current yoinker and its farcaster associated address.
- **`currentYoinkerPost`**: This directory contains the code for the current yoinker post API. It is responsible for updating the current yoinker, its farcaster associated address and the balance of the older yoinker.
- **`flowingBalance`**: This is an API that we used to generated the flowing balance at the last frame. It's an SVG image and it cannot be used as is.
- **`leaderboardApi`**: This directory contains the code for the leaderboard API. It is responsible for returning the leaderboard data of the game.
- **`leaderboard`**: This directory contains the code for the leaderboard page. It is responsible for displaying the leaderboard data.
