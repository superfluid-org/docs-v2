# Distribution Pools Explained

## Introduction

Distributions is a Superfluid primitive that allows scalable are one-to-many or many-to-many transfer of value, in the form of discreet transfers or [Money Streaming](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview.mdx).
Superfluid's implementation of this concept allows for the creation of **Pools** with a designated **pool admin** who manages **units** for **pool members**.
Members of these pools can receive funds either instantly or through continuous streaming, making this method highly efficient and scalable.
We make the difference between two types of Distributions:

- **Instant Distribution**: They allow one discreet transfer of Super Tokens to any number of receivers with a fixed gas cost.
- **Streaming Distribution**: They allow for continuous distribution of funds to receivers through [Money Streaming](/docs/protocol/money-streaming/overview.mdx) to a Pool.

:::note About Pools
The same pool can be used to distribute any Super Token, be it for Instant or Streaming Distributions.

### How It Works

1. **Create a Pool**: Deploying a pool contract creates a pool with a unique address.
2. **Assigning Proportions**: The pool admin sets proportions by allocating units to pool members.
3. **Distributing Tokens**: Pool members receive tokens based on their unit holdings.

Distributions are persistent, allowing multiple triggers with varying amounts. Units can be adjusted as needed.

## Key Concepts

- **Pool**: Channels for proportional token distribution.
- **Pool Admin**: Decides of the most important parameters of the distribution, including units.
- **Pool Members**: Receivers allocated units for distribution.

## Balancing Formula

Calculates the current balance of an account subscribed to one or more distribution Indices.

Publishers can manage multiple Indices, and subscribers can be part of multiple Indices.
</Admonition>

## Pool Administration and Member Participation

Pool admins manage units and distributions, while members receive distributions based on their units.

<PoolStreamVisualization/>
</div>
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <p>*Visualization of money streaming from an external source to a Pool and its members*</p>
</div>

### Distribution Types

- **Instant Distribution**: One-time proportional token allocation.
- **Streaming Distribution**: Continuous flow of tokens over time.

### Major Design Choices

- **Pool Administration**: Admins have control over unit management and token distribution.
- **Member Participation**: Members receive distributions proportionate to their units.
- **ERC20 Compatibility**: The Pool interacts seamlessly with ERC20 standards.
